### Auto-completion of Dutch case law references

Any Dutch law student will recognize the painstaking effort it takes to maintain case law references in footnotes in the right format ("Leidraad Juridische auteurs"). I wrote a Python script that will create a 
correctly formatted footnote based on just the ECLI of a case (crawling the websites of the ECHR, ECJ and Rechtspraak.nl). This way, during the writing process, you can simply put the ECLI in your footnote and quickly complete them later. 
It's available on <a href="https://github.com/jhvanstaalduinen/JuridischeVoetnoten">my GitHub</a>.
