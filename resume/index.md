## Academic
**Presentation at NetMob 2019:**

![alt text](../assets/img/netmob.jpg "IMG")


My first time at a real academic conference! As winners of the Foursquare Future Cities Challenge, we got to present our work in the special session _Future Cities Challenge: Future Cities for Good_, of the 2019 NetMob conference in Oxford. 

The work we did was actually a course project for a master's course on urban data. [Click here](../assets/docs/fcc19_paper_8.pdf) for our session paper. Foursquare also published a [blog post](https://enterprise.foursquare.com/intersections/article/how-location-technology-can-drive-urban-innovation/ "Future Cities Challenge")
 on the challenge/competition.

Apart from this, nothing cool yet. I am, however, currently working on my master thesis as a research intern at the Leiden University Medical Center.

## Business
**Internships at De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek and NautaDutilh:**

In the summer of 2018, I was a student trainee for two months at this Dutch law firm. In Spring 2020, I was a student trainee for two months at 'Nauta'. The first month was with the Competition team in Amsterdam. The second was with the Finance team in New York, which was very cool :).

## Education
**BSc in Computer Science**

At Leiden University. My bachelor thesis was on tracking methods for animals, supervised by J.N. Kok (who since then has moved to the University of Twente to lead their Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science).

**LLB in Law**

Also in Leiden. After completing my bachelor in Computer Science and a few electives on IT law, I thought I'd go for the full bachelor's in Law. This actually went quite well, as I managed to complete the three-year degree in two years while also completing their Honours College Law program.
