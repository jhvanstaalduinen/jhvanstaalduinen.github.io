## Academic
**Presentation at NetMob 2019**

![alt text](../assets/img/netmob.jpg "IMG")


My first time at a real academic conference! As winners of the Foursquare Future Cities Challenge, we got to present our work in the special session _Future Cities Challenge: Future Cities for Good_, of the 2019 NetMob conference in Oxford. 

The work we did was actually a course project for a master's course on urban data. [Click here](../assets/docs/fcc19_paper_8.pdf) for our session paper. Foursquare also published a [blog post](https://enterprise.foursquare.com/intersections/article/how-location-technology-can-drive-urban-innovation/ "Future Cities Challenge")
 on the challenge/competition.

Apart from this, nothing cool yet. I am, however, currently working on my master thesis as a research intern at the Leiden University Medical Center.

## Business
**Internships at De Brauw (AMS) and NautaDutilh (AMS/NY), business course with Stibbe (NY)**

In the summer of 2018, I was a student trainee for two months at De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek, a Dutch law firm in the prestigious Amsterdam business area. Then, in Spring 2020, I was a student trainee for two months at NautaDutilh. The first month of this internship was with the Competition team in Amsterdam, where I received hands-on experience with the practical intricacies of European competition law. The second month was with the Finance team in New York, which was, besides very informative, of course also very cool :). I must say I very much enjoyed the atmosphere in this daunting city. Previously, I had the opportunity to visit the same city as a participant of Stibbe's business course "STBB2NY".

## Education
**BSc in Computer Science**

At Leiden University. My bachelor thesis was on tracking methods for animals, supervised by J.N. Kok (who since then has moved to the University of Twente to lead their Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science).

**LLB in Law**

Also in Leiden. After completing my bachelor in Computer Science and a few electives on IT law, I thought I'd go for the full bachelor's in Law. This actually went quite well, as I managed to complete the three-year degree in two years while also completing their Honours College Law program.
